Using on PC:
	If you want to use posteffect for PC like in the demo video:

	1) Download unity free posteffects 
	https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/post-processing-stack-83912
	2) Add "PostProcessingBehaviour.cs" on main Camera.
	3) Set the "PostEffects" profile. ("\Assets\ErbGameArt\Glowings orb Vol 2\Demo scene\CC.asset")
	4) You should turn on "HDR" on main camera for correct posteffects. (bloom posteffect works correctly only with HDR)
	If you have forward rendering path (by default in Unity), you need disable antialiasing "edit->project settings->quality->antialiasing"
	or turn of "MSAA" on main camera, because HDR does not works with msaa. If you want to use HDR and MSAA then use "MSAA of post effect". 
	It's faster then default MSAA and have the same quality.

Using on MOBILES:
	For better perfomance on mobiles in your project scene you can
	Open Add_CenterGlow and Blend_CenterGlow shaders using notepad and change the code like in demo scene txt files (Ctrl+C in txt file | Ctrl+A Ctrl+V in Shader code).
