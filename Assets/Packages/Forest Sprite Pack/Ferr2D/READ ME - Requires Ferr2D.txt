This content inside the "Forest Sprite Pack/ Ferr2D" folder requires the Ferr2D plugin in order to work.
Make sure to have the Ferr2D package imported into the project before importing this folder from the Forest Sprite Pack, just to ensure the Terrain Materials are set up properly.
But in the case you already have the Ferr2D Package into the projecta and are experiencing errors, you can just delete the "Forest Sprite Pack/ Ferr2D" folder, import the Ferr2D Package, and then reimport the "Forest Sprite Pack/ Ferr2D".

For playing the playable demo inside "Forest Sprite Pack/ Ferr2D/ Ferr2D Playable Demo" folder, make sure to have the "Forest Sprite Pack/ Scenes/ Playable Demo Scene/ 2D Character Controller" imported into the project as well, since that's the character controller used in the scene.
